# mdsite

A modern generator for old-school static sites. Under construction!

`mdsite` generates an HTML website from any tree of Markdown files.

## Installation

You will need to install [Bun](https://bun.sh) first. Then:

```
git clone https://github.com/benchristel/mdsite
cd mdsite
bun install
```

Put the `mdsite` directory on your `PATH` somehow, probably by adding
a line like the following to your `.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/mdsite"
```

## Usage

Run `mdsite` to build the Markdown files in `./src` recursively into `./docs`.
