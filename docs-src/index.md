# @benchristel/mdsite

`mdsite` is a modern generator for old-school static sites.
It can turn any tree of markdown files into a website like this one (but you can style it however you want!)

## What makes `mdsite` different?

`mdsite` aims to be:

- easy to start using
- easy to stop using, with minimal lock-in
- a thin layer on top of the tech you already know: files, markdown, and HTML.
- great for web books, blogs, and documentation.
