# Installation

You will need to install [Bun](https://bun.sh) first. Then:

```
git clone https://github.com/benchristel/mdsite
cd mdsite
bun install
```

Put the `mdsite` directory on your `PATH` somehow, probably by adding
a line like the following to your `.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/mdsite"
```
