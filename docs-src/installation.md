# Installation

Install `@benchristel/mdsite` with your favorite JavaScript package manager.

```bash
bun i -g @benchristel/mdsite        # Install with Bun
npm i -g @benchristel/mdsite        # ...or with NPM
yarn global add @benchristel/mdsite # ...or with Yarn
```

Installing with Bun is recommended. `mdsite` will run significantly faster if you use Bun.
