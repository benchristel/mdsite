# A Custom Index Page

This tutorial assumes you've completed [the previous one](./hello-world.md).

When you visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you see an index page
that was generated automatically by `mdsite`. This page can be customized! This tutorial will
show you how to do that.

## Step 1: Create index.md

Use your favorite editor to create an `index.md` file in your `src` folder.
Or you can run:

```bash
echo 'this is the index page' > src/index.md
```

Then, run

```bash
mdsite
```

to build your project.

You should now see your custom index page when you visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Step 2: Add a table of contents

The autogenerated index.html had a table of contents that linked to your "hello world" page. By customizing
the index.html page, we lost that functionality. In this step, we'll add it back.

Use your editor to add a `{{macro toc}}` line at the end of index.html. The whole file should look like this:

```md
this is the index page

{{macro toc}}
```

Run `mdsite` again. You should now see your custom index page, with a link to the "hello world" page, when
you visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
